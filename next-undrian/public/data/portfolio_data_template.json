    "bio": "I had a major stroke when I was 62 in 2014. With therapy, I learned to\nwalk and talk again, but remain unable to use my right (dominant) hand and\narm. Before the stroke I had written poems and stories, and in 2015-6 I\ntried writing again, some of which is in the Writing folder. I had another\nstroke in 2017 and we moved cross country to live with our son Sam. In the\npast I had built furniture and sculpture, and, although I hadnâ€™t used the tools\nsince my major stroke, I had them moved as well. Sam set up a workshop\nin our shared house, and, with his help, I decided to see what I could make\none handed."
