    "bio": "I had a major stroke when I was 62 in 2014. With therapy, I learned to\nwalk and talk again, but remain unable to use my right (dominant) hand and\narm. Before the stroke I had written poems and stories, and in 2015-6 I\ntried writing again, some of which is in the Writing folder. I had another\nstroke in 2017 and we moved cross country to live with our son Sam. In the\npast I had built furniture and sculpture, and, although I hadn’t used the tools\nsince my major stroke, I had them moved as well. Sam set up a workshop\nin our shared house, and, with his help, I decided to see what I could make\none handed."

Who’s there? It’s your savior. Your savior who you know.\n\nHe sees everything, “forgive us our sins” is his informant.\n\n\n\nHate your mother and your father, leave all this and follow.\n\nPulled from the corner a dead scar thickens against the doorman.\n\nTime stops its tripping, the child remembered lasts not a moment",

      "poem": "You’re making a mechanism that’s making a mechanism\n\nThat’s making a mechanism that’s making you, that’s making you.\n\nYou lay down in your bed, can’t sleep the whole night through.\n\nYou keep tossing turning like the mechanism making you…\n\nAre not sleeping, toss and turn, ruminate awaiting god damn dawn…\n\nCome back here. Better not run. Hurts him more after he’s gone.\n\nMechanic belt slips the miller wife who cut his tongue on the pulley slice…\n\nHe gets up from the floor to dilute dirty tears\n\nWipe his cheek slapped upright wet behind burning ears…\n\nYou keep splashing your face like the mechanism making you.\n\nYou work in the factory where they tell you what to do…\n\nNo one knows this is a performance art work,\n\nLooking for the next paycheck…\n\nHeal the sick, cure the blind, cast out demons into swine,\n\nBut no trick was near as fine as turning water into wine…\n\nThere must be something on a better station\n\nBroadcasting live between reality and reruns…\n\nThe prophet  gnashes his teeth, “Who hid my pepperoni?”\n\nWe prefer our simple food, we don’t need something fancy…\n\nYou ask if your nightmare is a dream that’s coming true.\n\nYou keep running sinful like the mechanism making you…\n\nMelanoma, heart attack, rats in attic chew on traps…\n\nAn endless loop in the bible belt, he needs the leather his savior felt…\n\nHow in hell can a man clear the sand from his eye,\n\nWhen he can’t find his way cause they turned out the light…\n\nEvery night sweep up the same floor, looking at the clock…\n\nHa ha ha, cheap red wine, drink a glass to pass the time…\n\nWhen you watch television with nothing to turn to,\n\nYou keep changing channels like the mechanism making you…\n\nShut that door, don’t let the chill go to waste. Spoil your supper…\n\nYou keep eating cold cuts like the mechanism making you…\n\nAre not sleeping, toss and turn…\n\nRun down time for his own good…\n\nWhen he won’t go back home and burp up mouth of bile…\n\nWait in line to punch the time card…\n\nDon’t remember, never mind…\n\nThat blacks out childhood…\n\nThere’s a mess served better cold…\n\nYou’re making a mechanism that’s making a mechanism\n\nThat’s making a mechanism that’s making you, that’s making you…\n\nThere must be somewhere the viewers flip between\n\nThe victim they despise and ghosts they never believe.",
